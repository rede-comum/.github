**Rede Comum** is an open-source protocol and a set of tools designed to create a federated network of local commerce. Our mission is to empower small and medium-sized businesses to thrive in the digital age without relying on large, centralized platforms.

We believe in a future where local economies are strengthened by technology, not replaced by it.
